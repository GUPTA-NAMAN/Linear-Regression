# Linear-Regression
It is an implementation of linear regressor 
In this example ,
I have an dataset of power plant in which each observation(training example) have five variable's namely Temprature , Ambient pressure,Exhaust humidity  and Net Daily electrical energy .
I have trained my Ridge Regressor on mean-zero , unit-variance Normalized data-set(not done on variable to be predicated) to predict Net Daily electrical energy .
